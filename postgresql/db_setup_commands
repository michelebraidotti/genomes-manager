=== In psql console
create user genomes with password '12345';
create database genomes;
grant all on database genomes to genomes;

=== In bash console:
psql genomes < genomes.sql

=== In psql console:
ALTER USER genomes SET search_path = sequence,annotation,aux,public;


=== Setting up postgres configuration.
Change /etc/postgresql/9.1/main/pg_hba.conf
add this line before any line referring to 'local' 'all' 'all' 'peer' or 'md5':

# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   genomes         all                          	        trust

or something that lets you connect to the database as genomes user.

Make sure that in /etc/postgresql/9.4/main/postgresql.conf
the following line is not commented:

listen_addresses = 'localhost'          # what IP address(es) to listen on;

and that the port is set to 5432:

port = 5432                             # (change requires restart)

=== Test postgresql setup.
Log in with "psql genomes --username=genomes".
Run "nmap -sT -O localhost" and make sure that "5432/tcp  open  postgresql" is reported in the command output.
